{"name":"socialmediadata_beeradvocate","title":"BeerAdvocate","description":"Beer Reviews from the Beeradvocate\n\nThis dataset consists of beer reviews from [Beeradvocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com/). The data span a period of more than 10 years, including all ~1.5 million reviews up to November 2011. Each review includes ratings in terms of five \"aspects\": appearance, aroma, palate, taste, and overall impression. Reviews include product and user information, followed by each of these five ratings, and a plaintext review. We also have reviews from ratebeer. \n\n[Source: Stanford SNAP Lab](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Vote.html)\n\n---\n\nWe've included a dataset **beer_reviews** foud on TCB Analytics. The dataset is large so cannot be previewed. \n\nBlurb from TCB Analytics:\n\"This dataset consists of 1.5 million beer reviews from Beer Advocate. It is an ideal dataset for testing candidates since it is too large to fit into Excel, but small enough to process on a single laptop in Python or R. We prefer that candidates complete the test in either Python or R, and generally if they are hesitant about using or trying to learn either of these languages, that should signal a red flag.\" \n\n_Source:_ [TCB Analytics](http://tcbanalytics.com/blog/testing-data-skills.html#.WFmfT7YrK35)","homepage":"https://data.world/socialmediadata/beeradvocate","resources":[{"name":"beer_reviews","schema":{"fields":[{"name":"brewery_id","title":"brewery_id","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"brewery_id"},{"name":"brewery_name","title":"brewery_name","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"brewery_name"},{"name":"review_time","title":"review_time","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"review_time"},{"name":"review_overall","title":"review_overall","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"review_overall"},{"name":"review_aroma","title":"review_aroma","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"review_aroma"},{"name":"review_appearance","title":"review_appearance","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"review_appearance"},{"name":"review_profilename","title":"review_profilename","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"review_profilename"},{"name":"beer_style","title":"beer_style","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"beer_style"},{"name":"review_palate","title":"review_palate","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"review_palate"},{"name":"review_taste","title":"review_taste","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"review_taste"},{"name":"beer_name","title":"beer_name","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"beer_name"},{"name":"beer_abv","title":"beer_abv","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"beer_abv"},{"name":"beer_beerid","title":"beer_beerid","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"beer_beerid"}]},"path":"data/beer_reviews.csv","format":"csv"},{"name":"original/beer_reviews.csv","path":"original/beer_reviews.csv","format":"csv","mediatype":"text/csv","bytes":180174429},{"name":"original/wiki-Vote.txt","path":"original/wiki-Vote.txt","format":"txt","mediatype":"text/plain","bytes":1095061},{"name":"original/wiki-Vote.txt.gz","path":"original/wiki-Vote.txt.gz","format":"gz","mediatype":"application/x-gzip","bytes":290339}],"keywords":["beer","alcohol","best beers","reviews"]}
